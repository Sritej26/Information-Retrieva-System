A: I said "Wikileaks is trending now" when I should have just said it was a popular news story. What's happening to me?! B: The internet has ruined your mind. Reading pop culture on the internet is the worst thing you could do to your ability to communicate in plain English short of taking up a career in contract law. Hence "trending." The definition of “trending” (a topic) be the subject of many posts on a social media website within a short period of time. Ex: "I've just taken a quick look at what's trending on Twitter right now" This is true for the term trending unless you’re talking about trending on YouTube in which case is not actually trending at all. Trending on youtube is simply videos that are not popular at all and are forced down people’s throats. Although this is YouTubes truth, videos by creators like Shane Dawson get 6 million views in 8 hours (9/25) (‘The Mind of Jake Paul’) and THAT is the actual definition of trending. thank you for coming to my ted talk.
