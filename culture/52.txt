Culture & Festivals Sukrunye Festival Sukrunye (January): It is celebrated during the middle of January. Of all the festivals it is the most important because it is the ceremony to ensure good health of the community during the coming year. The main highlight of the festival is “SUKRU” meant for the menfolk. It implies the sanctification of the young boys. Earlier in the morning all menfolk visit the village spring, where they wash themselves, their weapons and tools and cloth in fresh water before any animals touch the water. They believe all misfortunes and physical ailments have been washed away. On return, every male who is old enough to do so kills an unblemished cock, but it must be killed by throttling it with his hand only. Thus, it stretches to days of celebration by feasting, dancing and singing through out the day and night till dawn
