CULTURAL FESTIVAL OF INDIA, UK:The first Cultural
Festival of India in London captivates the British in England: 'India Dawns
in London' - a display on many London city buses proudly
heralded the Cultural Festival of India in the city of London.
And truly, for 33 days, from 15 July to 18 August 1985,
the whole of U.K. basked in the magic of Cultural India. The Festival was the first of its kind in the West. Eighteen
acres of the famous Alexandra Palace were transformed into
a cultural wonderland which gave precious glimpses of India's
music and melodies, science and spiritualism, arts and architectures...
The outstanding feature was that all the gigantic structures
were crafted in India, shipped to London and assembled as
a large jigsaw.
