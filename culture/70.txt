2018 French Cultures Festival Spoken by more than 274 million people on the five continents and by 2.1 million people in the United States, French language is the second most widely learned language in the world. Since 1970, French language has been celebrated on March 20, which marks the birth of the Intergovernmental Organization of French-speaking nations (Organisation internationale de la francophonie). Each year in March, the Cultural Service of the French Embassy in Houston organizes the French Cultures Festival (FCF) in Texas, Oklahoma, and Arkansas. A celebration of the diversity of "francophonie", it brings together people who not only speak French, but also feel, in one way or another, connected to France and the Francophone community. One of the major objectives of the French Cultures Festival is to create awareness of the diversity of contemporary French culture and to stimulate exchanges with the public. The FCF gathers many institutional partners from museums, universities, schools, diplomatic representations, and many other organizations. Last year, over 40 cultural and educational events were showcased during the Festival in the three states covered by the Cultural Service. A kick-off celebration of the Festival will take place in Houston, featuring two bands from French-speaking countries and one local band. They will be performing on the outdoor stage of Discovery Green. Delicacies from Francophone countries will also be offered by our food vendors. The French Cultures Festival is supported by Total Petrochemicals & Refining USA, the Government of Canada, ENGIE North America, the Qu√©bec Government Office in Houston, Schlumberger, TV5MONDE USA, Four Seasons Hotel Houston, Pauvarel Moss Law Firm, Sallymoon Benz, the Consulate of Switzerland andthe Swiss American Society of Houston.
