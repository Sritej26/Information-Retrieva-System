Technology Development Programmes (TDP) is to convert proof-of-concepts for development of pre-competitive/commercial technologies/ techniques/ processes. The commercialization of these technologies needs further assessment/incubation, which does not fall in the scope of the Technology Development Programme. Transfer of technology developed under the project to the industry should ideally be the onus of the host institutions. Proposals of incremental R&D over the existing technologies may be considered for support. Theme based concept proposals for proof of feasibility will not be considered under TSDP-DST. Only full fledged complete proposals for development of technology/process/product will be considered under TSDP. Projects related to design and development of Software/IT, as required for products and processes, as a part of technology development project shall be considered. Pure software development does not fall in the scope of the programme.

Objective Of The Scheme The primary objective of the Programme is to facilitate and support development of products or techniques/technology aimed at specific end use. The Programme stresses on clearly identifying the needs for development of the technology so that the developmental effort could be useful to the target beneficiary. It envisages active user involvement and association in the development effort. The intention is that the products/technologies developed under the Programme become useful for the benefit of the people at large. The specific objectives of the Programme are to develop and integrate technologies following a holistic approach in identified areas facilitate enhancing quality and performance of the traditional/non-traditional items encourage developments in application of R&D activities promote activities aimed at improving technology, technique, material, methods and other appropriate activities conducive for development of technology status in identified areas. Eligibility The Project Proposals could be submitted for financial support by scientists/engineers/ technologists working in academic institutions/registered societies/R&D institutions/laboratories having adequate infrastructure/facilities to carry out Technology Development work/prototype building.
