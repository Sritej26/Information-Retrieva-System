Cricket Home About Cricket Cricket is a high performance, extremely flexible system for
monitoring trends in time-series data. Cricket was expressly
developed to help network managers visualize and understand
the traffic on their networks, but it can be used all kinds of
other jobs, as well. Cricket has two components, a collector and a grapher. The
collector runs from cron every 5 minutes (or at a
different rate, if you want), and stores data into a
datastructure managed by RRD Tool.
Later, when you want to check on the data you have
collected, you can use a web-based interface to view graphs
of the data. Cricket reads a set of config files called a config tree. The
config tree expresses everything Cricket needs to know about
the types of data to be collected, how to get it, and from which
targets it should collect data. The config tree is designed to
minimize redundant information, making it compact and easy to
manage, and preventing silly mistakes from occurring due to
copy-and-paste errors. Supported OSs Cricket is developed on Solaris machines running under Apache.
It is known to work on Linux, HP-UX, variants of BSD, and other
operating systems. Some users are successfully using Cricket
under Windows NT and/or Windows 2000, but at this time, no one
has documented this. Sponsors Cricket was originally written for WebTV Networks, Inc.
It was subsequently publically released under the GNU General Public License. Without
the full support of WebTV's management, Cricket would still be
an internal tool. You can thank them for their support
indirectly by supporting literacy
programs, which (among other great things) increase
WebTV's potential market! Cricket's home page is hosted by SourceForge.
