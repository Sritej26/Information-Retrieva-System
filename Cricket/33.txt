We have reduced support for legacy browsers. What does this mean for me? You will always be able to play your favorite games on Kongregate. However, certain site features may suddenly stop working and leave you with a severely degraded experience. What should I do? We strongly urge all our users to upgrade to modern browsers for a better experience and improved security.
